Experimenting with the Canny edge detector implementation in scikit-image

I used edited code from a PluralSight course by Janani Ravi to experiment
with the Canny edge detector in scikit-image.

If interested in additional comments, I invite you to read the follwoing
post in my blog:

Remember that one of the best ways to learn is to read, experiment, and
repeat as needed.

Enjoy,
